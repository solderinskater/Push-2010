= pushgems

i will now explain how to include gems to ruby code running on the maemo.

== usage

put/link the "pushgems.rb" file somewhere that already is in the interpreter
include path (like "." or "/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.8").

now we can use it like rubygems:

  require 'pushgems'
  require 'myspecialgem'
  
qed.

== ruby background

as there is no version for rubygems on freemantle right now, we do the gem path
including by hand. we'll do this in a rather low-level way, by simply doing:

  $: << "/path/to/gem"
  
thereby manipulating the ruby include path variable.

this is done automatically by requiring the "pushgems.rb" file. it basically
looks like this:

  #path of the gem directory on the maemo device
  gempath = "/opt/pushitcode/pushitrealgood/maemo/gems"
  #list of gems we want to include
  gems = ["rofl","ruby-dbus","dbus-client"]
  #now we add the gems to the interpreter include variable ($:)
  gems.each do |gem|
    $: << "#{gempath}/#{gem}/lib"
  end
  
you might need to configure the "gempath" and "gems" variable to make it work
you.
