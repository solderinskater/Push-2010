= ROFL

My little logger wrapper. Will give you easy access to logger functions with
class and caller method info.

== Installation

  sudo gem install pangdudu-rofl --source=http://gems.github.com
  
== Usage

=== Logging

look at the test_rofl.rb or simply do this:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rofl'
  
you can then use the methods: elog,wlog,ilog,dlog

where elog is like: 
      logger.error "text if you like"
wlog is like: 
      logger.warn "text if you like"
ilog is like: 
      logger.info "text if you like" 
dlog is like: 
      logger.debug "text if you like"


=== Tracing

If you take a look at 'lib/rofl_trace.rb' you'll discover some fun stuff. :)

What might come in handy if you have no clue whats going on in somebodies code:

  rofl_enable_trace
  #...some code
  rofl_disable_trace
  
You can encapsule code like that and then get flodded with all the 'calls'
that happen in the vm.

/^(call)/ is the default regexp, but there's more fun stuff to trace out there: returns, sends, ...


Have phun kidz!
