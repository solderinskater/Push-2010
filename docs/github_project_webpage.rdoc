= Github webpage howto

hi kids. in order to add/edit content to the github project page: 
  
  http://pangdudu.github.com/pushitrealgood
  
you need to check out the "gh-pages" branch of the project containing the html-docs:

  git pull origin gh-pages
  
this will pull the website content. edit and push as usual.
